  <title>Sets</title>
  <p>
    We start off by providing a <q>definition</q> of a basic mathematical structure to which we will soon add bells and whistles. We use quotes here because what follows doesn't have the precision we usually require when defining a mathematical object.
  </p>

  <definition> <statement><p> A <term>set</term> is an (unordered)
    collection of objects.  </p></statement>
</definition>

  <p>
    This is only sort of  a <q>definition</q> because it is not a
    rigorous definition of a set. For instance, what do we mean by a
    <q>collection</q> of objects? This <q>definition</q> will be sufficient for
    our course, but be warned that defining a set in this vague way can
    lead to some serious mathematical issues, such as <em>Russell's
    paradox</em>.  A mathematician whose expertise is in set
    theory may scowl disagreeably if you try to define a set as we have
    above.
  </p> 

    <note>
    <p>
    Let <m>S</m> be the set of all sets that aren't members
    of themselves.  Is <m>S</m> a member of itself? If you think carefully
    about this, you'll see that <m>S</m> can be neither a member of itself,
    nor <em>not</em> a member of itself. Uh oh!  This contradiction
    is known as <q>Russell's paradox</q> (named for the British philosopher, mathematician, and all-round academic Bertrand Russell). Mathematicians deal with this by
    declaring that some object collections, called <em>classes</em>, are
    not in fact sets.</p>

<notation><usage>x \in S</usage><description><m>x</m> is an element of <m>S</m></description></notation>
<notation><usage>x \not\in S</usage><description><m>x</m> is not an element of <m>S</m></description></notation>
<notation><usage>\emptyset</usage><description>the empty set, <m>\{\}</m></description></notation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The members of a set are called its <term>elements</term>. If
        <m>S</m> is a set, we write <m>x\in S</m> to indicate <q><m>x</m> is an element
        of <m>S</m>,</q> and <m>x \not\in S</m> to indicate <q><m>x</m> is not an element
        of <m>S</m>.</q> There is a unique set containing no elements; it is
        called the <term>empty set</term>, and denoted by <m>\emptyset</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>


  </definition>


  <p>
    Sets must be <em>well-defined</em>: that is, it must be clear
    exactly which objects are in a set, and which objects aren't.
    For instance, the set of all integers is well-defined, but the
    set of all big integers is not well-defined, since it is
    unclear what <q>big</q> means in this context.
  </p>

  <p>
    We refer to some sets so frequently in mathematics that we have special notation for them.
  </p>

<example>
<statement><p>
<notation><usage>\Z</usage><description>the set of all integers</description></notation>
<notation><usage>\Q</usage><description>the set of all rational numbers</description></notation>
<notation><usage>\R</usage><description>the set of all real numbers</description></notation>
<notation><usage>\C</usage><description>the set of all complex numbers</description></notation>
<notation><usage>\N</usage><description>the set of all natural numbers, <m>\{0,1,2,\ldots\}</m></description></notation>
<notation><usage>\Z^+,\Q^+,\R^+</usage><description>the set of all positive elements of <m>\Z,\Q,\R</m></description></notation>
<notation><usage>\Z^-,\Q^-,\R^-</usage><description>the set of all negative elements of <m>\Z,\Q,\R</m></description></notation>
<notation><usage>\Z^*,\Q^*,\R^*,\C^*</usage><description>the set of all nonzero elements of <m>\Z,\Q,\R,\C</m></description></notation>Some common sets are:
<dl>
<li><title><m>\Z</m></title><p>the set of all integers  (the <m>\Z</m> comes <q>zahlen,</q> the German word for <q>numbers</q>)</p></li>
<li><title><m>\Q</m></title><p>set of all rational numbers</p></li>
<li><title><m>\R</m></title><p>the set of all real numbers</p></li>
<li><title><m>\C</m></title><p>the set of all complex numbers</p></li>
<li><title><m>\N</m></title><p>the set of all natural numbers, i.e., <m>\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}</m></p><p> (Be aware that many books/mathematicians do not include <m>0</m> in the set of natural numbers</p></li>
</dl>
We can further write denote by <m>\Z^+</m> the set of all positive integers, and by <m>\Z^*</m> the set of all nonzero integers.
Can you guess what the penultimate notation represents if we replace <m>\Z</m> with <m>\Q</m> or <m>\R</m>, and/or <m>+</m> with <m>-</m>? What about 
what the last notation, if we replace <m>\Z</m> with <m>\Q</m>, <m>\R</m>, or <m>\C</m>?
</p>
</statement>


</example>
 
  <p>
    We also provide notation for commonly considered sets of matrices:
  </p>

<definition>

<notation><usage>\M_{m\times n}(S)</usage><description>the set of all <m>m \times n</m> matrices over <m>S</m></description></notation>
<notation><usage>\M_n(S)</usage><description>the set of all <m>n \times n</m> matrices over <m>S</m></description></notation>
<statement><p>
 Given <m>m,n\in \Z^+</m> and a set <m>S</m>, we define <m>\M_{m\times n}(S)</m> to
    be the set of all <m>m\times n</m> matrices over <m>S</m> (that is, of all <m>m\times n</m> matrices with entries in <m>S</m>). We use the
    shorthand notation <m>\M_n(S)</m> for the set <m>\M_{n\times n}(S)</m>.</p></statement>

    </definition>
  


  <p>
    One common way of describing a set is to list its elements in
    curly braces, separated by commas; you can use ellipses to
    indicate a repeated pattern of elements. A few examples are
    <m>\{1,4,\pi\}</m>, <m>\{3, 4, 5, \ldots\}</m>, and <m>\{\ldots, -4, -2, 0,
    2, 4, \ldots\}</m>; the last of these can be written more concisely as <m>\{0,\pm 2, \pm 4,\ldots\}</m>. Note that since elements of a set are
    unordered, the sets <m>\{1,4,\pi\}</m> and <m>\{4,\pi, 1\}</m>, for
    instance, are identical.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another method is using <term>set-builder notation</term>. This consists of an element name (or
    names), followed by a colon (meaning <q>such that</q>), followed by
    a Boolean expression involving the element name(s), all
    surrounded by curly braces.</p>

 
  <warning><p>The use of a colon to denote <q>such that</q> is <em>only</em> valid in the above set-builder notation context.  Outside of this context, you should never use a colon to denote <q>such that</q>; instead, use the abbreviation <q>s.t.</q> or write out the actual words.   Conversely, never use one of those ways of indicating <q>such that</q> within set-builder notation; always use a colon there.  Why?  Convention.</p></warning>
<p>
    For example, <me> \{x\in \Z : x > 4\} </me> is the set <m>\{5, 6, 7, \ldots\}</m>, while <me> \{z\in \C : |z|=1\}</me> is the set of all complex numbers at distance 1 from the origin in the complex plane.
  </p>
  <note>

  <p>
    If one simply writes <m>\{x\,:\,x>4\}</m>,
    it is unclear what this set is; it could be the set of all
    integers greater than 4, or the set of all real numbers greater
    than 4, or something else. When one can, it is better to
    identify the named element(s) as a member (members) of a known
    set, such as <m>\R</m> or <m>\Z</m>, whenever possible.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <notation><usage>A\subseteq B</usage><description> <m>A</m> is a subset of the <m>B</m></description></notation>
<notation><usage>A\subsetneq B</usage><description> <m>A</m> is a proper subset of <m>B</m></description></notation>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Set <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m> (and set <m>B</m> is a <term>superset</term> of <m>A</m>) if every element in <m>A</m> is also in <m>B</m>. We
        denote <q><m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m></q> by <m>A\subseteq B</m>. Sets <m>A</m>
        and <m>B</m> are said to be <term>equal</term>, and we write <m>A=B</m>, if they
        contain exactly the same elements; equivalently, <m>A=B</m> if and
        only if <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B\subseteq A</m>. Set <m>A</m> is a <term>proper</term> subset of set <m>B</m> if <m>A\subseteq B</m> but <m>A\neq B</m>; we
        write this <m>A\subsetneq B</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>


  </definition>


      <remark>
      <p> Sometimes the notation <m>A\subset B</m> is  used to
        indicate that <m>A</m> is a proper subset of <m>B</m>, and sometimes it is simply used to mean that <m>A</m> is a subset<mdash />proper or improper<mdash />of <m>B</m>. We will not use the notation <m>A \subset B</m> in this text. </p></remark>
     

  <note>
    <p>
      One often proves that two sets <m>A</m> and
      <m>B</m> are equal by proving that <m>A\subseteq B</m> and <m>B\subseteq A</m>.
    </p>
  </note>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We have the following: <m>\Z^+ \subseteq \Z \subseteq \Q \subseteq \R \subseteq \C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>

    <notation><usage>P(A)</usage><description>the power set of <m>A</m></description></notation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>power set</term> of <m>A</m>, denoted <m>P(A)</m>, is the set of
        all subsets of <m>A</m>. (Note that the power set of any set
        contains the empty set as an element.)
      </p>
    </statement>

  </definition>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Be careful to use your curly braces correctly when writing power sets!
      Remember, the power set of a set is a <em>set of sets</em>.
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    The following provides a good example of using braces correctly.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A=\{a,b\}</m>, then <m>P(A)=\{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\}</m>. Note that the element <m>\{a,b\}</m> of <m>P(A)</m> could also be written simply as <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <statement>
      <p><ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are subsets of a set <m>U</m>, then the <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cup B</m>, is the set
            <m>A\cup B=\{x\in U : x\in A \text{ or }  x\in B\};</m> the <term>intersection</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cap B</m>, is the set

        <li>
          <p>
            More generally, given any collection of subsets <m>A_i</m> (<m>i</m> in some index set <m>I</m>) of a set <m>U</m>, the <term>union</term> of the <m>A_i</m> is <me>\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i=\{x\in U: x\in A_i \text{ for some }  i\in I\},</me> and the <term>intersection</term> of the <m>A_i</m> is <me>\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i=\{x\in U: x\in A_i \text{ for every }  i\in I\}.</me>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <em>disjoint</em> if <m>A\cap B=\emptyset</m>.  More generally, sets <m>A_i</m> (<m>i</m> in some index set <m>I</m>) are
            <em>disjoint</em> if <me>\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i=\emptyset</me> and are <em>mutually disjoint</em> if<me>A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset \text{ for all } i\neq j \in I. </me>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
     
  </definition>

  <p>
    Notice that for any subsets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> of a set <m>U</m>, <m>A\cap B \subseteq A \subseteq A\cup B</m> and
    <m>A\cap B \subseteq B \subseteq A\cup B</m>. Also note that if sets <m>A_i</m> (<m>i \in I</m>) are mutually disjoint then they are also disjoint, but they may be disjoint without being mutually disjoint. For example, the sets <m>\{i, i+1\}</m> for <m>i\in \Z</m> are disjoint but not mutually disjoint. (Do you see why?)

  <p>
    We define one more way of <q>combining</q> sets.

    <notation><usage>A\times B</usage><description>the direct product of  <m>A</m> and <m>B</m></description></notation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. Then the <term>direct product</term> (or <term>Cartesian 
        product</term>) <m>A\times B</m> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set
        <me>A\times B =\{(a,b): \text{\(a\in A\), \(b\in B\)} \}.</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        An element <m>(a,b)</m> of
        <m>A\times B</m> is called an <term>ordered pair</term>. More generally, if
        <m>A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n</m> are sets for some <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, then the
        <term>product</term> of the <m>A_i</m> is
        <me>A_1\times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n=\{(a_1, a_2 \ldots, a_n): a_i \in A_i \text{ for
          } i=1,2, \ldots, n\}; </me>
        the elements <m>(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)</m> of this
        product are called <m>n</m>-tuples (or triples, if <m>n=3</m>). (You can also have products of infinitely many sets, but we will
        not discuss that in this course.) Finally, if each set <m>A_i</m> is
        the same set <m>A</m>, we can use the notation <m>A^n</m> to denote the
        product
        <me>A\times A \times \cdots \times A</me>
        of <m>n</m> copies of
        <m>A</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        For example, the Cartesian plane is the set <m>\R^2</m>, and the set <m>\Z \times \R</m> consists of exactly the points in the plane with integer <m>x</m>-coordinates
        (that is, the points that lie on vertical lines intersecting the <m>x</m>-axis at integer values).

  <title>Functions</title>
  <p>
    You have probably encountered functions before. In introductory
    calculus, for instance, you typically deal with functions from
    <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m> (e.g., the function <m>f(x)=x^2</m>). More generally,
    functions <q>send</q> elements of one set to elements of another set;
    these sets may or may not be sets of real numbers. We provide below
    a <q>good enough for government work</q> definition of a function.
  </p>

  <definition>

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>function</term> <m>f</m> from a set <m>S</m> to a set <m>T</m> is a
        <q>rule</q> that assigns to each element <m>s</m> in <m>S</m> a unique
        element <m>f(s)</m> in <m>T</m>; the element <m>f(s)</m> is called the <term>image of <m>s</m> under <m>f</m></term>. If <m>f</m> is a function from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m>,
        we write <m>f: S \to T</m>, and call <m>S</m> the <term>domain</term> of <m>f</m> and
        <m>T</m> the <term>codomain</term> of <m>f</m>. The <term>range</term> of <m>f</m> is

      <p>
        More generally, if <m>U \subseteq S</m>, the <term>image of <m>U</m> in <m>T</m> under <m>f</m></term> is

      <p>
        If <m>V\subseteq T</m>, the <term>preimage of <m>V</m> in <m>S</m> under <m>f</m></term> is the set
        <me>f^{\leftarrow}(V)=\{s\in S: f(s)\in V\}.</me>

  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>f: \Z \to \R</m> defined by <m>f(x)=x^2</m>.
        The domain of <m>f</m> is <m>\Z</m> and the codomain of <m>f</m> is <m>\R</m>; the
        range of <m>f</m> is <m>\{x^2\,:\,x\in \Z\}=\{0,1,4,9,\ldots\}</m>. The image
        of <m>\{-2,-1,1,2\}</m> under <m>f</m> is the two-element set <m>\{1,4\} \subseteq

    The following definitions will be very important in our future work.

  <remark><p>
    We will often have to show functions are one-to-one or onto. Given a function <m>f:S\to T</m>, the following methods are recommended.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
To prove that <m>f</m> is one-to-one: Let <m>s_1,s_2 \in S</m> with <m>f(s_1)=f(s_2)</m> and prove that then <m>s_1=s_2</m>.</p>
<p>
<alert>Note: It is <em>not</em> sufficient to prove that if <m>s_1=s_2</m> in <m>S</m> then <m>f(s_1)=f(s_2)</m>; that holds true for ANY function from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m>!  Be careful to <em>assume</em> and <em>prove</em> the correct facts.</alert></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To prove that <m>f</m> is <em>not</em> one-to-one: Identify two elements <m>s_1 \neq s_2</m> of <m>S</m> such that <m>f(s_1)=f(s_2)</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>

        Consider the function <m>f: \R^* \to \R^+</m> defined by <m>f(x)=x^2</m>. Function <m>f</m> is <em>not</em> one-to-one: indeed,
        <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> are in <m>\R^*</m> with <m>f(-1)=1=f(1)</m> in <m>\R^+</m>.
        However, <m>f</m> <em>is</em> onto: indeed, let <m>t\in \R^+</m>. Then
        <m>\sqrt{t} \in \R^*</m> with <m>t=f(\sqrt{t})</m>, so we're done.

<p>We have the following useful theorems.</p>

    <proof>
    <p>Suppose <m>f</m> has inverse <m>g</m>. Let <m>t\in T</m>. Then <m>f(g(t))=t</m>, so <m>f</m> is onto.  Next, suppose

<p>  Conversely, suppose <m>f</m> is a bijection.  Then for every <m>t\in T</m>, there exists a unique element <m>s_t\in S</m> such that <m>f(s_t)=t</m>. It is then straighforward to show that the function <m>g:T\to S</m> defined by <me>g(t)=t_s \text{ for every }t\in T</me> is an inverse of <m>f</m>.</p>

  <proof><p>Suppose <m>f</m> has inverses <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>. Then for every <m>t\in T,</m>

  <title>Cardinality</title>
  <p>
    One of the set traits that will be useful to us in
    distinguishing between algebraic structures is <em>cardinality</em>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p> <notation><usage>|S|</usage><description>the cardinality of  <m>S</m></description></notation>
        A set is <term>finite</term> if it contains a finite number of
        elements;
        otherwise, it's <term>infinite</term>. The <term>cardinality</term> of a finite set <m>S</m> is the
        number of elements in <m>S</m>; we denote the cardinality of <m>S</m> by <m>|S|</m>. When <m>S</m> is infinite, we may
        write <m>|S|=\infty</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
   
  </definition>


    <warning><p>Of course, vertical bars are used to denote
    other mathematical concepts; for instance, if <m>x</m> is a real
    number, <m>|x|</m> usually denotes the absolute value of <m>x</m>. You
    must determine from context, and from the nature of the
    expression within the bars, what vertical bars mean in a
    particular context.</p></warning>

<p>Note that in the above definition, we omitted the definition of the cardinality of an infinite set.  This is because defining the cardinality of an infinite set is a more complicated endeavor, and one which is, in the most general context, beyond the scope of this class.  For us it will suffice to distinguish between two types of infinite sets: <em>countably infinite</em> sets and <em>uncountable</em> (or <em>uncountably infinite</em>) sets.</p>




<definition>
    <statement>
       <p> A set <m>S</m> is said to be <term>countably infinite</term> if there exists a bijection from <m>S</m> to <m>\Z</m> (equivalently, if there
        exists a bijection from <m>\Z</m> to <m>S</m>). It is said to be <term>countable</term> if it is finite or countably infinite, and <term>uncountable</term> (or <term>uncountably infinite</term>) if it is not countable.</p>

      </statement>

 
   </definition>

<p>  Here are some straightforward examples to get us started:</p>

  <example>
  <p>

 
    <ol>
    <li> <m>|\{a,b\}|=2</m>. </li>
    <li><m>|\emptyset|=0</m>.</li>
    <li> Clearly, <m>\Z</m> itself is countably
        infinite.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  </example>

<remark>
<p>It turns out that countably infinite sets have the same cardinality as one another, while a countably infinite set and an uncountable set have different cardinalities. Intuitively, you  can think  of two countably infinite sets as having the same <q>size,</q> and a countable set and an uncountable set as having different <q>sizes</q>; however, this is a risky way of framing things, since it can  make some results seem counterintuitive when you're used to dealing only with finite sets (see, for instance, <xref ref="zplus">Example</xref>).  Luckily, exploring the cardinality of infinite sets isn't the focus of this class.</p></remark>

  <p>
    Perhaps surprisingly, a proper subset of a set can have the
    same cardinality as its superset, as the following example
    shows.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="zplus">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We claim that <m>\Z^+</m> is countably infinite. Indeed, consider the function <m>f:\Z^+ \to \Z</m> defined by <m>f(n)=(-1)^n \lfloor n/2 \rfloor</m>, where <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m>
        denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to <m>x</m>, for each <m>x\in \R</m>. The fact that <m>f</m> is a bijection is demonstrated (though not proven) by the following visual representation,
        where each number maps via <m>f</m> to the value directly to the right of it:

</sidebyside>


      <p>
        Note that this means that <m>\Z</m> and its proper subset <m>\Z^+</m>
        have the same cardinality, that is, the same <q>size</q>!
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    We summarize here examples of countably and uncountably
    infinite sets. (On pp. 5<ndash />6 of<nbsp /><xref ref="F" />, Fraleigh sketches proofs of the
    facts that <m>\Q</m> is countable and that the interval <m>(0,1)</m>
    in <m>\R</m> is uncountable. The proof then that <m>\R</m> is
    uncountable follows from <xref ref="cardthm">Theorem</xref>, below.)
  </p>
<p>Countably infinite sets: <m>\Z</m>, <m>\Z^+</m>, <m>\Z^-</m>, <m>\Z^*</m>, <m>\Q</m>, <m>\Q^+</m>, <m>\Q^-</m>, <m>\Q^*</m>, <m>\N</m></p>
<p>Uncountably infinite sets: <m>\R</m>, <m>\R^+</m>, <m>\R^-</m>, <m>\R^*</m>, <m>\C</m>, <m>\C^*</m>,  the interval <m>(0,1)</m> in <m>\R</m></p>     

  <p>
    The key idea here for us is that if two sets are
    essentially <q>the same,</q> then they must have the same <q>size.</q>
    Thus, we see that there is some fundamental difference between
    the sets <m>\Z</m> and <m>\R</m> (in fact, there are many such
    differences). On the other hand, cardinality alone won't allow
    us to distinguish structurally between the sets <m>\Z</m> and
    <m>\Z^+</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We end our preliminary chapter with the following theorem and a corollary of it (which can be proved using induction on <m>n</m>). We omit the proofs of the first two statements.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="cardthm">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A\subseteq B</m> and <m>A</m> is infinite [uncountable] then so is <m>B</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A\subseteq B</m> and <m>B</m> is finite [countable] then so is <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
     

          <li>
            <p>
           If <m>|A|=m\lt \infty</m> and <m>|B|=n\lt  \infty</m>, then <m>|A\times B|=mn</m>.  More generally, if <m>n>1</m> is an integer and <m>A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n</m>  are sets with <m>|A_i|=k_i\lt \infty</m> for each <m>i=1,2,\ldots, n</m>, then <m>|A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n|=k_1k_2\cdots k_n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>



          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be countable sets. Then <m>A \times B</m> is countable. More generally,  if <m>n>1</m> be an integer and <m>A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_n</m> are countable  sets, then <m>A_1\times A_2\times \cdots \times A_n</m> is countable.</p>
              
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>

<proof>
  <p>You prove the first statement in Part 3 in your homework. The second statement in Part 3 follows using induction on the number of sets.</p>
  <p>
  To prove the first statement in Part 4: Assume that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both countably infinite. Since <m>\Z^+</m> is countably infinite, we can index the elements of <m>A</m> and of <m>B</m> by <m>\Z^+</m>, writing
    <me>A=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots\} \text{ and }  B=\{b_1,b_2,\ldots\}.</me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that the table
</p>

<sidebyside>

<tabular>
   <row >
    <cell ><m>(a_1,b_1)</m></cell>
    <cell><m>(a_1,b_2)</m></cell>

    <cell><m>\cdots</m></cell>

  </tabular>
  </sidebyside>
    
    <p>contains every element of <m>A\times B</m>. We can then list the elements of <m>A\times B</m> by listing the elements in progressive upper-right to lower-left diagonals, starting with <m>(a_1,b_1)</m> and moving to the right along the top row: that is, we can write
    <me>A\times B=\{(a_1,b_1),(a_1,b_2),(a_2,b_1),(a_2,b_3),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_1),\ldots\}.</me>
  </p>

  <p>
    This implicitly yields a bijection from <m>\Z^+</m> to <m>A\times B</m>; thus, <m>A\times B</m> is countably infinite, and hence countable.
  </p>

  <p>
    The proof in the case that one or both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are finite is similar; the corresponding table in that case will simply have either only finitely many rows or finitely many columns, or both.</p> 

<p>The second statement in Part 4 follows using induction on the number of sets.</p>



  </proof>
</theorem>

  <remark><p>It is <em>not</em> true that any countable product
              of countable (or even finite) sets is countable. Indeed, even
              the set <m>\{0,1\}\times \{0,1\}\times \cdots</m> is
              uncountable. (If you want to get into the gory details
              of this, the key is that there is a bijection from this set to
              the power set of the natural numbers, which Cantor's Theorem
              tells us is uncountable.  You are welcome to jump down this
              rabbit hole by googling <q>Cantor's Theorem,</q> if you desire, but
              know that you will not be responsible for that material in
              class.)</p></remark>
