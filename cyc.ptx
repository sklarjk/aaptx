  <title>Introduction to cyclic groups</title>
  <p>
    Certain groups and subgroups of groups have particularly nice structures.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A group is <term>cyclic</term> if it is isomorphic to <m>\Z_n</m> for some <m>n\geq 1</m>, or if it is isomorphic to <m>\Z</m>.
      </p>

        Examples/nonexamples of cyclic groups.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>n\Z</m> and <m>\Z_n</m> are cyclic for every <m>n\in \Z^+</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\R</m>, <m>\R^*</m>, <m>\M_2(\R)</m>, and <m>GL(2,\R)</m> are uncountable and hence can't be cyclic.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\Z_2^2</m> is <em>not</em> cyclic since it would have to be isomorphic to <m>\Z_4</m> if it were (since it has order 4).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\Q</m> isn't cyclic. If it were cyclic it would have to be isomorphic to <m>\Z</m>, since <m>\Q</m>
              is an infinite group (so can't be isomorphic to <m>\Z_n</m> for any <m>n</m>). But we showed in <xref ref="zq">Example</xref> that <m>\Q \not\simeq \Z</m>.

      Clearly, cyclicity is a group invariant.

  <theorem xml:id="abcyc">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is cyclic, then <m>G</m> is abelian; however, <m>G</m>
        can be abelian but not cyclic.
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
    <p>
      Since <m>\Z</m> and each <m>\Z_n</m> are abelian, every cyclic group is abelian. But, for instance, <m>\R</m> is an abelian noncyclic group (it can't be cyclic because it is uncountable).
    </p>

  <definition>
   <notation><usage>\langle a \rangle </usage><description>the (cyclic) subgroup generated by <m>a</m></description></notation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> be an element of a group <m>G</m>. Then
        <me> \langle a\rangle  = \{a^n:n\in \Z\}=\{\ldots, a^{-2},a^{-1},a^0,a^1,a^2,\ldots\}</me>

      Note that in the above definition, we were using
      multiplicative notation. Using additive notation, we have

        Let <m>a</m> be an element of a group <m>G</m>. Then <m>\langle a\rangle \leq G</m>.

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>x,y\in \langle a\rangle</m>. Then <m>x=a^i</m>, <m>y=a^j</m> for some <m>i,j\in \Z</m>. So <m>xy=a^ia^j=a^{i+j}\in \langle a\rangle</m>. Next, <m>e_G=a^0\in H</m>. Finally, <m>(a^i)^{-1}=a^{-i}\in H</m>. So <m>\langle a\rangle</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
    </p>

</theorem>



<p>We next prove a lemma to which we will refer when proving the theorem which succeeds it.</p>

<lemma xml:id="clock"><title>Clock Lemma</title> <statement><p> Let <m>G</m> be a group and let <m>a \in G</m>. Suppose there is a positive power of <m>a</m> which equals the identity element <m>e</m> of <m>G</m>. Let <m>n</m> be the least such positive integer. Then for all <m>s,t\in \Z</m>, <m>a^s=a^t</m> if and only if <m>s</m> is congruent to <m>t</m> modulo <m>n</m>. In particular, if <m>s\in \Z^+</m> with <m>a^s=e,</m> then <m>n</m> divides <m>s</m>.
    </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
     Let <m>s,t\in \Z</m>. By the <xref ref="divalg" text="title"/>, there exist <m>q\in \Z</m> and <m>r\in \Z_n</m> with <m>s-t=qn+r</m>. Then <m>a^{s-t}=a^{qn+r}=(a^n)^qa^r=e^qa^r=a^r</m>. Since <m>0\leq r\lt n</m>, be definition of <m>n</m> we have that <m>a^{s-t}=e</m> if and only if <m>r=0</m>; that is, <m>a^s=a^t</m> if and only if <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> are congruent modulo <m>n</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>The last statement follows from the fact that <m>n</m> divides any positive integer to which it is congruent modulo itself.</p>
  </proof>
</lemma>


  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group with identity element <m>e</m>, and let <m>a\in G</m>. Then the group <m>\langle a\rangle</m> is cyclic.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
  <p>
    <em>Case 1.</em> There is no positive integer <m>k</m> with <m>a^k=e</m>. In this case, we claim <m>\langle a\rangle \simeq \Z</m>. Indeed: Let <m>\phi:\Z\to \langle a\rangle</m> be defined by <m>\phi(i)=a^i</m>. Clearly, <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism that is onto. So to show that <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism, it suffices to show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one. Let <m>i,j\in \Z</m> with <m>\phi(i)=\phi(j)</m>. Then <m>a^i=a^j</m>. Without loss of generality, we may assume <m>i\geq j</m>. Then, multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>a^{-j}</m> (on the right or on the left) we obtain <m>a^{i-j}=e</m>. Since <m>i-j\in \N</m> and there is no positive integer <m>k</m> with <m>a^k=e</m>, we must have <m>i-j=0</m>, so <m>i=j</m>. Thus, <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism from <m>\Z</m> to <m>\langle a\rangle</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Case 2.</em>  There is a positive integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a^k=e</m>. In this case, let <m>n</m> be the least such positive integer. Define <m>\phi:\Z_n\to \langle a\rangle</m> be defined by <m>\phi(i)=a^i</m>. We claim that <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism.
  </p>

<p> First, let <m>i,j\in \Z</m>. We want to show that <m>\phi(i+_nj)=\phi(i)\phi(j)</m>, that is, that <m>a^{i+_nj}=a^ia^j</m>. Since <m>i+j</m> is congruent to <m>i+_nj</m> modulo <m>n</m>, <m>a^ia^j=a^{i+j}=a^{i+_nj}</m>, by the <xref ref="clock" text="title"/>. So <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism. Next we show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one. Let <m>i,j\in \Z_n</m> with <m>\phi(i)=\phi(j)</m>, so <m>a^i=a^j</m>. Then, by the Clock Lemma, <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> are congruent modulo <m>n</m>. Since they're both in <m>\Z_n</m>, they must be equal,
    so <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one. Finally, we show that <m>\phi</m> is onto. let <m>x\in \langle a\rangle</m>. Then <m>x=a^i</m> for some <m>i\in \Z</m>. Letting <m>r</m> be the remainder when we divide <m>i</m> by <m>n</m>, we have <m>r\in \Z_n</m> with <m>i</m> congruent to <m>r</m> modulo <m>n</m>; so, again using the <xref ref="clock" text="title"/>, <m>x=a^i=a^r</m>. Since <m>r\in \Z_n</m>, <m>x=\phi(r)</m>. So <m>\phi</m> is onto.</p>
<p>Thus, <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism, and so in this case we have <m>\Z_n \simeq \langle a \rangle</m>.

  <definition>

    <notation><usage>o(a)</usage><description>the order of element <m>a</m></description></notation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group and let <m>a\in G</m>. We define the <term>order</term> of <m>a</m>, denoted <m>o(a)</m>, to be <m>|\langle a\rangle |</m>. (Note: If there exists a positive integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a^k=e</m>, then the least such integer is the order of <m>a</m>; otherwise, <m>o(a)=\infty</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
      </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Do not confuse the order of a group with the order
      of an <em>element of a group</em>. These are related concepts, but they are distinct, and have distinct
      notations: as we've seen, the order of a group, <m>G</m>, is denoted by
      <m>|G|</m>, while the order of an element <m>a</m> of a group is denoted by
      <m>o(a)</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

<theorem xml:id="eltorderdivides">
<statement>
<p>Let element <m>a</m> in group <m>G</m> have <m>o(a)=k \lt \infty</m>. Then for <m>m\in \Z^+</m>, <m>a^m=e</m> if and only if <m>k</m> divides <m>m</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p>This follows from the last statement of the Clock Lemma.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>


  <p>
    We have the following handy theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="invord">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a\in G</m>. Then <m>o(a)=o(a^{-1})</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      First, assume <m>o(a)=n\lt \infty</m>. Then
      <me> (a^{-1})^n=(a^n)^{-1}=e^{-1}=e,</me>
      so <m>o(a^{-1})\leq n=o(a)</m>. Using the same argument, we have <m>n=o(a)\leq o(a^{-1})</m>. Since <m>o(a^{-1})\leq n</m> and <m>n\leq o(a^{-1})</m>, <m>o(a^{-1})=n=o(a)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, assume <m>o(a)= \infty</m>. Then <m>a^{-1}</m> must also have infinite order, since if it had finite order <m>m</m>, <m>a</m> would, by the above argument, have order less than or equal to <m>m</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>


  <p>
    Unfortunately, there's no formula one can simply use to compute the order
    of an element in an arbitrary group. However, in the special case
    that the group is cyclic of order <m>n</m>, we do have such a formula. We
    present the following result without proof.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="znorders">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each <m>a\in \Z_n</m>, <m>o(a)=n/\gcd(n,a)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>


<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>m,n \in \Z^+</m> and let <m>(a,b)\in \Z_m \times \Z_n</m>. Let <m>c, d</m> be the respective orders of <m>a</m> in <m>\Z_m</m> and 
<m>b</m> in <m>\Z_n</m>. Then <m>o((a,b))=\lcm(c,d)</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>k\in \Z^+</m>. By definition of <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> and by <xref ref="eltorderdivides">Theorem</xref>, we have <m>k(a,b)=(ka,kb)=(0,0)</m> if and only if <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> divide <m>
k</m>. Since <m>\gcd(c,d)=1</m>, the least positive integer divisble by both <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> is <m>\lcm(c,d)</m>. Thus, <m>o((a,b))=\lcm(c,d)</m>, as desired.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

    <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>m,n\in \Z^+</m> with <m>\gcd(m,n)=1</m>. Then <m>\Z_m \times \Z_n</m> is cyclic.
      </p>
</statement>
    
<proof>
<p>
Since <m>\gcd(m,n)=1</m>, <m>\lcm(m,n)=mn</m>. So 
<me>o((1,1))=\lcm(m,n)=mn=|\Z_m \times \Z_n|,</me> and we see that <m>(1,1)</m> generates <m>\Z_m \times \Z_n</m>.</p>

            In <m>\Z</m>, <m>\langle 2\rangle =\{\ldots,-4,-2,0,2,4,\ldots\}=2\Z</m>. More generally, given any <m>n\in \Z</m>, in <m>\Z</m> we have <m>\langle n\rangle =n\Z</m>. For <m>a\in \Z</m>, <m>o(a)=\infty</m> if <m>a\neq 0</m>; <m>o(0)=1</m>.

      Let <m>G</m> be cyclic. Suppose <m>|G|=\infty</m>. Then there is an isomorphism <m>\phi: \Z\to G</m>. Note that <m>\Z=\langle 1\rangle</m>. So

            Given <m>n\geq 2</m> in <m>\Z</m>, the generators of <m>\Z_n</m> are exactly  the elements <m>a\in \Z_n</m> such that <m>\gcd(n,a)=1</m>. (This follows from <xref ref="znorders">Theorem</xref>.)

      Order of elements provides another group invariant.

  <theorem xml:id="ophia">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\phi:G\to G'</m> be a group isomorphism and let <m>a\in G</m>. Then <m>o(\phi(a))=o(a)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      This follows from the fact that <m>\phi(\langle a\rangle )=\langle \phi(a)\rangle</m>.

</theorem>

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If groups <m>G</m> and <m>G'</m> are isomorphic then for any <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, the number of elements of <m>G</m> of order <m>n</m> is the same as the number of elements of <m>G'</m> of order <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Since <m>1</m> in <m>\Z_4</m> has order 4 but every element in <m>\Z_2 \times \Z_2</m> has order less than or equal to 2, these groups cannot be isomorphic.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Note, however, that just because the orders of elements of two groups <q>match up</q> the groups need not be isomorphic. For example, every element of <m>\Z</m> has infinite order, except for its identity element, which has order 1; the same is true for the group <m>\Q</m>. However, we have previously proven that these groups are not isomorphic.

  <title>The subgroup lattices of cyclic groups</title>
  <p>
    We now explore the subgroups of cyclic groups. A complete proof of the following theorem is provided on p. 61 of<nbsp /><xref ref="F" />.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="subc">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    <em>Sketch of proof:</em> Let <m>G=\langle a\rangle</m> and <m>H\leq G</m>. If <m>H=\{e\}</m>, then clearly <m>H</m> is cyclic. Else, there exists an element <m>a^i</m> in <m>H</m> with <m>i>0</m>; let <m>d</m> be the least positive integer such that <m>a^d\in H</m>. It turns out that <m>H=\langle a^d\rangle</m>.
  </p>

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every subgroup of <m>\Z</m> is of the form <m>n\Z</m> for <m>n\in \Z</m>. (Note that <m>n\Z\simeq \Z</m> unless <m>n=0</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>

  <p>
    Really, it suffices to study the subgroups of <m>\Z</m> and <m>\Z_n</m> to understand the subgroup lattice of every cyclic group.
  </p>

  <p>
    We provide the following theorems without proof.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="znsubgps">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The nontrivial subgroups of <m>\Z_n</m> are exactly those of the form <m>\langle d\rangle</m>, where <m>d</m> is a positive divisor of <m>n</m>. Note that <me>|\langle d\rangle |=n/d</me> for each such <m>d</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each <m>0\neq a\in \Z_n</m>, 
        <me>\langle a\rangle =\left\langle \frac{n}{\gcd(n,a)}\right\rangle.</me> It follows that for each <m>0\neq a \in \Z_n,</m> <me>|\langle a\rangle |=\frac{n}{\gcd(n,a)}.</me></p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    In fact:
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>\Z_n</m> has a unique subgroup of order <m>k</m>, for each positive divisor <m>k</m> of <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        How many subgroups does <m>\Z_{18}</m> have? What are the generators of <m>\Z_{15}</m>?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, the positive divisors of <m>18</m> are <m>1,2,3,6,9,</m> and <m>18</m>, so <m>\Z_{18}</m> has exactly six subgroups (namely, <m>\langle 1\rangle</m>, <m>\langle 2\rangle</m>, etc.).
        The generators of <m>\Z_{15}</m> are the elements of <m>\Z_{15}</m> that are relatively prime to <m>15</m>, namely <m>1,2,4,7,8,11,13,</m> and <m>14</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Draw a subgroup lattice for <m>\Z_{12}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The positive divisors of <m>12</m> are <m>1,2,3,4,6,</m> and <m>12</m>; so
        <m>\Z_{12}</m>'s subgroups are of the form <m>\langle 1\rangle</m>, <m>\langle 2\rangle</m>, etc. So
        <m>\Z_{12}</m> has the following subgroup lattice.
