        Let <m>G</m> be the set of all functions from <m>\Z</m> to <m>\R</m>. Prove that pointwise multiplication on <m>G</m> is commutative. (<em>Note.</em> To prove that two functions, <m>h</m> and <m>j</m>, sharing the same domain <m>D</m> are equal, you need to show that <m>h(x)=j(x)</m> for every <m>x\in D</m>.)

      <me>(fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)=g(x)f(x),</me>
      since <m>f(x), g(x)\in \R</m> and multiplication of real numbers is commutative. Since <m>g(x)f(x)=(gf)(x)</m>,
      <m>fg=gf</m>, and so pointwise multiplication on <m>G</m> is commutative.

        Decide which of the following binary structures are groups. For each, if the binary structure <em>isn't</em> a group, prove that. (Remember, you should <em>not</em> state that inverses do or do not exist for elements until you have made sure that the structure contains an identity element!) If the binary structure <em>is</em> a group, prove that.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>n\in \Z</m>. Prove that <m>n\Z</m> is a group under the usual addition of integers. <em>Note:</em> You may use the fact that <m>\langle n\Z,+\rangle</m> is a binary structure if you provide a reference for this fact.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
    <p>
      We know from <xref ref="nz">Theorem</xref> that <m>\langle n\Z,+\rangle</m> is a binary structure.</p>
<p> Next, <m>+</m> is
            associative on <m>n</m>, since it's associative on
            <m>\Z</m>, and <m>n\Z \subseteq \Z</m>.
          </p>
        <p>            Notice that
            <m>0\in n\Z</m> (since <m>0=n(0)</m>); 0 then clearly acts as
            an identity element for <m>+</m> in <m>n\Z</m>.
          </p>
        <p>Finally, let <m>x\in n\Z</m>, then <m>x=nm</m> for some <m>m\in \Z</m>, so
            <m>-x=n(-m)</m> for <m>m\in \Z</m>, implying <m>-x\in n\Z</m>;
            and clearly <m>-x</m> acts as an inverse for <m>x</m> in
            <m>n\Z</m>.
          </p>
   

    <p>
      Thus, <m>\langle n\Z, +\rangle</m> is a group.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>n\in \Z^+</m>. Prove that <m>SL(n,\R)</m> is a group under matrix multiplication.
        <em>Note:</em> You may use the fact that <m>\langle SL(n\R),\cdot\rangle</m> is a binary structure if you provide a reference for this fact.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <solution>
    <p>
      We know from <xref ref="sl">Example</xref> that <m>\langle SL(n,\R),\cdot\rangle</m> is a binary structure,and we know that matrix multiplication is always associative. Next, since <m>\det I_n=1</m>, <m>I_n</m> is in <m>SL(n,\R)</m>, and clearly acts as an identity element in <m>SL(n,\R)</m>. Finally, let <m>A\in SL(n,\R)</m>.  Since <m>\det A=1\neq 0</m>, <m>A</m> has an inverse matrix <m>A^{-1}</m> in <m>GL(n, \R)</m>.  <m>A^{-1}</m> is in <m>SL(n,\R)</m> since
            <me> \det(A^{-1})=\frac{1}{\det A}=1/1=1.</me>
            So <m>A</m> has an inverse in <m>SL(n,\R)</m>.
          </p>
    <p>
      Thus, our proof is complete.
