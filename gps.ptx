  <title>Binary operations and structures</title>

  <p>
    So far we have been discussing sets. These are extremely simple
    objects, essentially mathematical <q>bags of stuff.</q> Without any
    added structure, their usefulness is very limited. Imagine, for
    instance, living with friends in a two-story house without rooms,
    stairs, closets, or hallways. You have no privacy, cannot access the
    second floor, etc. A set with no added structure will not help us,
    say, solve a linear equation. What <em>will</em> help us with such
    things are objects such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces.
    These are sets equipped with <em>binary operations</em> which allow us
    to combine set elements in various ways. We first rigorously define
    a binary operation.

  <definition>
   
<notation><usage>\langle S, *\rangle </usage><description>binary structure </description></notation>
 <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>binary operation</term> on a set <m>S</m> is a function from
        <m>S\times S</m> to <m>S</m>. Given a binary operation <m>*</m> on <m>S</m>, for
        each <m>(a,b)\in S\times S</m> we denote <m>*((a,b))</m> in <m>S</m> more
        simply by <m>a*b</m>. (Intuitively, a binary operation <m>*</m> on <m>S</m>
        assigns to each pair of elements <m>a,b \in S</m> a unique element
        <m>a*b</m> of <m>S</m>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        A set <m>S</m> equipped with a binary operation <m>*</m> is called a <term>binary (algebraic) structure</term>, and is denoted by <m>\langle S,*\rangle</m>, or
        just by <m>S</m>, if <m>*</m> is understood from context.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          For <m>*</m> to be a binary operation on <m>S</m>, <m>a*b</m> must be
          <em>well-defined</em> and <em>in</em> <m>\mathbf{S}</m> for each <m>a,b\in S</m>.
          For instance, we cannot define a binary operation on
          <m>\R</m> by
          <me>a*b=\text{ the greatest number less than
            \(a+b\)}</me>
          since there <em>is</em>  no such <q>greatest number.</q>
          Nor can we define a binary operation on <m>\Z</m> by <m>a*b=ab/2</m>,
          since for, say, <m>a=b=1 \in \Z</m>, <m>ab/2=1/2 \not\in \Z</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Not every binary operation is denoted by <m>*</m>.  In fact, many already have common notations: for instance, <m>+</m> on <m>\Z</m> or <m>\circ</m> on the set of functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>. We will assume these common notations represent the <q>usual</q> binary operations we know them to mean, unless otherwise noted.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Do not mix up the <m>*</m> that indicates a binary operation and the
          superscript <m>^*</m> that indicates that we are only considering the
          nonzero elements of a given set (e.g., <m>\R^*</m>). You should be
          able to tell which type of <m>*</m> we are using from context and
          placement. Also, make sure you correctly place these symbols!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol></p>
  </remark>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A binary operation <m>*</m> on a set <m>S</m> is <term>associative</term>
        if <m>(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)</m> for all <m>a,b,c\in S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      When a binary operation is associative,
      we can omit parentheses when operating on set elements. For
      example, <m>+</m> is associative on <m>\Z</m>, so we can unambiguously
      write the (equal) expressions <m>1+(2+3)</m> and <m>(1+2)+3</m> as
      <m>1+2+3</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A binary operation <m>*</m> on set <m>S</m> is <term>commutative</term> if
        <me>a*b=b*a</me>
        for all <m>a,b\in S</m>. We say that specific elements
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of <m>S</m> <term>commute</term> if <m>a*b=b*a</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\langle S,*\rangle</m> be a binary structure. An element <m>e</m> in
        <m>S</m> is an <term>identity element of <m>\langle S,*\rangle</m></term> if <m>x*e=e*x=x</m> for all
        <m>x\in S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <note>

  <p>
    Sometimes an identity element of <m>\langle S,*\rangle</m> is referred to as an <term>identity element of <m>S</m> under <m>*</m></term>, or, when <m>*</m> is clear from context, simply
    as an <term>identity element of <m>S</m></term>.
  </p>

  </note>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Not every binary structure contains an identity element! (Ex: <m>\langle \Z,-\rangle</m>.)
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    A natural question to ask is if a binary structure can have
    more than one identity element? The answer is no!
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="uniqueid">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A binary structure <m>\langle S, *\rangle</m> has <em>at most one</em> identity element. That is, identity elements in binary structures, when they exist, are unique.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>e</m> and <m>f</m> are identity elements of <m>S</m>. Then since <m>e</m> is an identity element, <m>e*f=f</m> and since <m>f</m> is an identity element, <m>e*f=e</m>. Thus, <m>e=f</m>.
    </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\langle S, *\rangle</m> be a binary structure with identity
        element <m>e</m>. Then for <m>a\in S</m>, <m>b</m> is an <term>(two-sided)
        inverse of <m>a</m> in <m>\langle S,*\rangle</m></term> if <m>a*b=b*a=e</m>.

  <note>

  <p>
    We can also refer to such an element <m>b</m> as an <term>inverse for <m>a</m> in <m>S</m> under <m>*</m></term>, or, when <m>*</m> is clear from context, simply as an <term>inverse of <m>a</m></term>.

  <warning>

    <ul>
      <li><p>
          Not every element in a binary structure with an identity element has an inverse!

      <li>
        <p>
          If a binary structure <em>does not have</em> an identity element, it <em>doesn't even make sense</em> to say an element in the

  <theorem xml:id="uniqueinverse">

        Let <m>\langle S, *\rangle</m> be a binary structure with an identity element, where <m>*</m> is associative. Let <m>a\in S</m>. If <m>a</m> has an inverse, then its inverse is unique.

      Let <m>e</m> be the identity element of <m>S</m>. Suppose <m>a</m> has inverses <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>. Then <m>a*b=e</m> so, multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>c</m> on the left, we have <m>c*(a*b)=c*e=c</m>. But since <m>*</m> is associative, we have <m>c*(a*b)=(c*a)*b=e*b=b</m>. But <m>b=c</m>. Thus, <m>a</m>'s inverse is unique.

  </theorem>

<p>We end by discussing the idea of <em>closure</em> under a binary operation.</p>

 <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>Let <m>\langle S,*\rangle</m> be a binary structure and let <m>T \subseteq S</m>. Then <m>T</m> is said to be <em>closed</em> under <m>*</m> if <m>t_1 * t_2 \in T</m> whenever <m>t_1,t_2\in T</m>. </p>
    </statement>

<example xml:id="closed1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the binary structure <m>\langle \M_2(\R), +\rangle</m>, where <m>+</m> denotes matrix addition.  Let \[T=\{A\in M_2(\R): A \mbox{ is invertible}\}.\]  We claim that <m>T</m> is <em>not</em> closed under <m>+</m>. Indeed, if we denote the identity matrix in <m>\M_2(\R)</m> by <m>I_2</m>, then we observe that <m>I_2, -I_2\in T</m>, but <m>I_2+(-I_2)\not\in T</m>, since the zero matrix isn't invertible. </p>

<example xml:id="closed2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the binary structure <m>\langle \M_2(\R), \cdot\rangle</m>, where <m>\cdot</m> denotes matrix multiplication.  Again, let <m>T</m>  be the set of all invertible matrices in <m>\M_2(\R)</m>. We claim that <m>T</m> is closed under <m>\cdot\,</m>. Indeed, let <m>A,B\in T</m>. Then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are invertible, so their determinants are nonzero. Thus, <m>\det(AB)=(\det A)(\det B)\neq 0,</m> so <m>AB</m> is invertible, and hence  <m>AB\in T</m>.</p>

<section xml:id="gpdef">
  <title>The definition of a group</title>
  <p>
    At this point you may be asking yourself, why do we care? We've covered a lot of definitions and proved some theorems, but what is the goal of all this? Well, there are actually many goals that we can achieve using such material. Consider the following as an example. Suppose we want to solve the equation <m>5+x=2</m>. We can probably solve this quite easily almost just by looking at it (<m>x=-3</m>), but what facts are we actually using there? If we break down the reasoning leading to this answer, we may obtain something like the following, where each line is equivalent to the one preceding it.

 <md>
          <mrow>5+x\amp =2 </mrow>
          <mrow>-5+(5+x)\amp =-5+2</mrow>
          <mrow>(-5+5)+x \amp =-3</mrow>
          <mrow>0+x\amp =-3</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp =-3.</mrow>
        </md>

    In the second line we add the inverse of <m>5</m> in <m>\langle \Z, +\rangle</m> to each side of
    the equation; in the third line we use associativity of <m>+</m> in <m>\Z</m> (along
    with computation); and in the fourth line we use the fact that <m>-5</m> is the
    additive inverse of <m>5</m> (that is, the inverse of <m>5</m> in <m>\Z</m> under
    <m>+</m>). Finally, we use the fact that 0 is an additive
    identity element in <m>\Z</m> (that is, the identity element in <m>\Z</m>
    under <m>+</m>).
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, we used <em>associativity, identity elements, and
    inverses</em> in <m>\Z</m> to solve the given equation. This perhaps
    suggests that these would be useful traits for a binary
    structure and/or its operation to have. They are in fact so
    useful that a binary structure displaying these characteristics
    is given a special name. We note that these axioms are rather
    strong; <q>most</q> binary structures aren't groups.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>group</term> is a set <m>G</m>, equipped with a binary

          <li> <p>
              Every element <m>a\in G</m> has an inverse in <m>G</m>. (Axiom <m>\G_3</m>)

        <m>\langle G,*\rangle</m>, or simply by <m>G</m> if the operation <m>*</m> is known
        from context (or need not be known in the current
        situation).

        <p>
          The first thing you should do is check to make sure that  <m>\langle G,*\rangle</m>
          is a binary structure: that is, you should make sure that <m>a*b</m> is well-defined and in <m>G</m> for every <m>a, b \in G</m>. If this is not the case, it doesn't make sense to
          check to see if axioms <m>\G_1</m><ndash /><m>\G_3</m> hold). (For instance: <m>\Z^*</m> has no chance of being a group under
          <m>\div</m>, since, e.g., <m>3,4\in \Z^*</m> but <m>3 \div 4 \not\in\Z^*</m>.)

          You should never check <m>\G_3</m> before confirming

<p> Recall that given a square matrix <m>A</m>, the notation <m>\det A</m> denotes the

<me>GL(n,\R)=\{M\in \M_n(\R):\det M \neq 0\}</me> (that is, let <m>GL(n,\R)</m> be  the set of all invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrices over <m>\R</m>) , and let
<me>SL(n,\R)=\{M\in \M_n(\R):\det M =1\}</me>. These subsets of <m>\M_n(\R)</m> are called, respectively, the 
<term>general</term> and <term>special linear groups of degree <m>n</m> over <m>\R</m> </term>.</p>


</statement>
</definition>

<p>Note that these definitions imply that these subsets of <m>\M_n(\R)</m> are groups (under some operation). Sure enough, they are!</p>


  <theorem xml:id="gl">

 <statement>

 <proof>
<p>
  Let <m>A,B\in GL(n, \R)</m>. Then <m>\det(AB)=(\det A)(\det B) \neq 0</m> (since <m>\det A, \det B \neq 0)</m>, so <m>AB\in GL(n,\R)</m>.  Thus, 
  <m>\langle GL(n,\R), \cdot\rangle</m> is a binary structure.</p>
   <p>We know that matrix multiplication is always associative,so <m>\G_2</m> holds. Next, 
   <me>I_n= \begin{bmatrix}1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  \cdots \amp  0 \\
                0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  \cdots \amp  0 \\

                \vdots \amp  \vdots \amp  \vdots \amp  \ddots \amp  \vdots \\
                0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  \cdots \amp  1
                \end{bmatrix},</me> the  is in <m>GL(n,\R)</m>since <m>\det I_n=1\neq 0</m>, and it
     acts as an identity element for <m>\langle GL(n,\R), \cdot\,\rangle</m> since
              <me>AI_n=I_nA = A</me>
              for all <m>A\in GL(n,\R)</m>.
            </p>
        <p> Finally, let <m>A\in GL(n,\R)</m>.  Since <m>\det A\neq 0</m>, <m>A</m> has
              (matrix multiplicative) inverse <m>A^{-1}</m> in
              <m>\M_2(\R)</m>. But we need to verify that <m>A^{-1}</m> is in
              <m>G</m>. This is in fact the case, however, since
              <m>A^{-1}</m> is invertible (it has inverse <m>A</m>), hence <m>\det
              A^{-1} \neq 0</m>.  Thus, <m>A^{-1}</m> is also in <m>GL(n,\R)</m>.
            </p>

      <p>
        So <m>GL(n,\R)</m> is a group under multiplication.

<p>
  Let <m>A,B\in SL(n, \R)</m>. Then <m>\det(AB)=(\det A)(\det B) =1(1)=1</m>, so <m>AB\in SL(n,\R)</m>.  Thus,

      Throughout this course, if we are discussing a set <m>GL(n,\R)</m> or <m>SL(n,\R)</m>, you should assume <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, unless otherwise noted.
    </p>
  </remark>

<p>We end this section with a final example.</p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Define <m>*</m> on <m>\Q^*</m> by <m>a*b=(ab)/2</m> for all <m>a,b\in \Q^*</m>. Prove that <m>\langle \Q^*,*\rangle</m> is a group.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        First, <m>\langle\Q^*,\rangle</m> is a binary structure, since <m>(ab)/2</m> is
        rational and nonzero whenever <m>a,b</m> are rational and nonzero.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we check that <m>\Q^*</m> under <m>*</m> satisfies the group
        axioms. Since multiplication is commutative on <m>\Q</m>, <m>*</m> is
        clearly commutative on <m>\Q^*</m>, and so our work to show
        <m>\G_2</m> and <m>\G_3</m> is marginally reduced.</p>
<p>
       First, associativity of <m>*</m> on <m>\Q^*</m> is inherited
              from associativity of multiplication on <m>\Q^*</m>.</p>
<p> Notice that the perhaps <q>obvious</q> choice, 1, is
              <em>not</em> an identity element for <m>\Q^*</m> under
              <m>*</m>: for instance, <m>1*3=3/2 \neq 3</m>. Rather, <m>e</m> is such an
              identity element if and only if for all <m>a\in \Q</m> we
              have <m>a=e*a=(ea)/2</m>. We clearly have <m>a=(2a)/2</m> for all
              <m>a\in \Q^*</m>; so <m>2</m> acts as an identity element for
              <m>\Q^*</m> under <m>*</m>.
            </p>            <p>
              Finally, let <m>a\in \Q^*</m>.  Since <m>a\neq 0</m>, it makes
              sense to divide by <m>a</m>; then <m>4/a\in \Q^*</m>, with
              <m>a*(4/a)=(a(4/a))/2=2</m>.
            </p>
        
      <p>
        Thus, <m>\langle \Q^*,*\rangle</m> is a group.
      </p>

  <title>Group conventions and properties</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Before we discuss more examples, we present a theorem and look at some conventions we follow and notation we use when discussing groups in general; we also discuss some properties of groups.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Some group conventions</title>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The identity element of a group is
          unique (by <xref ref="uniqueid">Theorem</xref>), and given any element <m>a</m>
          of a group <m>G</m>, the inverse of <m>a</m> in <m>G</m> is unique (by <xref ref="uniqueinverse">Theorem</xref>).
        </p>
</statement>
    </theorem>

<observation>
<p>  <notation><usage>e_G</usage><description>the identity element in a group <m>G</m></description></notation>
                <notation><usage>a^{-1}</usage><description>the inverse of <m>a</m> in a group</description></notation>We will generally use <m>e</m>
          or <m>e_G</m> as our default notation for an identity element of group, but be aware that many mathematicians denote a group's identity element by 1. We  denote the inverse of element <m>a</m> in <m>G</m> by <m>a^{-1}</m>.</p>
        
          </observation>


 <warning>
            <p>
              Although it is written in what we call  <em>multiplicative
              notation</em>, do <em>not</em> assume <m>a^{-1}</m> is what we usually think of as a
              multiplicative inverse for <m>a</m>; remember, we don't even know if
              elements of a group are numbers! The type of inverse that <m>a^{-1}</m>
              is (a multiplicative inverse for a real number? an additive inverse
              for a real number? a multiplicative inverse for a matrix? an inverse
              function for a function from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>?) depends on both
              <m>G</m>'s elements and its operation.
            </p>
          </warning>

<convention><p>
        <ul>

<li><p> We usually <em>don't</em> use the notation <m>*</m> when describing group
          operations. Instead, we use the multiplication symbol <m>\cdot</m> for
          the operation in an arbitrary group, and  call
          applying the operation <q>multiplying</q><mdash />even though the operation may
          not be <q>multiplication</q> in the non-abstract, traditional sense! It may
          actually be addition of real numbers, composition of
          functions, etc. Moreover, when actually operating in a group <m>\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle</m>, we
          typically omit the <m>\cdot</m> . That is, for <m>a,b\in G</m>, we write the
          product <m>a\cdot b</m> as <m>ab</m>. We call this the <q>product</q> of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. </p>

        <p>
          For every element <m>a</m> in a group <m>\Gdot</m> and <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, we use the expression <m>a^n</m> to denote  the product <me>a \cdot a \cdot \cdots \cdot a</me> of <m>n</m> copies of <m>a</m>, 
      and <m>a^{-n}</m> to denote <m>(a^{-1})^n</m> (that is, the product of <m>n</m> copies of <m>a^{-1}</m>).
          Finally, we define <m>a^0</m> to be <m>e</m>.  Note that our <q>usual</q> rules for exponents then hold in an arbitrary group: that is, if <m>a</m> is in group <m>\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle</m>
          and <m>m,n\in \Z</m>, then <m>a^m a^n = a^{m+n}</m> and <m>(a^m)^n=a^{mn}=(a^n)^m</m>.
        </p>

        <p>However:</p>
      </li>  
  

<li><p>

            <notation><usage>-a</usage><description>the inverse of <m>a</m> in an abelian group</description></notation>
            When we know our operation is commutative, we typically
            use additive notation, denoting the group operation by <m>+</m>, calling the group operation <q>addition,</q> and denoting
            the inverse of an element <m>a</m> by <m>-a</m>. When
            we use additive notation, we do <em>not</em> omit the <m>+</m> when
            operating in a group <m>\langle G,+\rangle</m>, and we call <m>a+b</m> a <em>sum</em> rather
            than a product. Also, when working with an operation that is known to be commutative,  the identity element may be denoted by 0 rather than by <m>e</m>, <m>e_G</m>, or 1, and for <m>n\in \N</m>, we write <m>na</m> instead of <m>a^n</m>.</p>
            



            <p>Finally, note that
            <m>(-n)a=n(-a)=-(na)</m> (where <m>-a</m> and <m>-(na)</m> indicate the
            additive inverses of <m>a</m> and <m>na</m>, respectively); we can therefore
            unambiguously use the notation <m>-na</m> for this element.
            Using this notation, note that for <m>m\in \Z</m>, <m>na+ma=(n+m)a</m> and <m>n(ma)=(nm)a</m>.</p>
</li>

</ul></p>


</convention>
         
            <warning>
              <p>
                Be careful to always know where an element
                you are working with lives! For instance, if, as above, <m>n\in
                \Z^+</m> and <m>a</m> is a group element, <m>-n</m> and <m>-a</m> look similar but
                may mean very different things. While <m>-n</m> is a negative integer,
                <m>-a</m> may be the additive inverse of a matrix in <m>\M_2(\R)</m>, the
                additive inverse 2 of the number 4 in <m>\Z_6</m>, or even something
                completely unrelated to numbers.
              </p>
            </warning>

  
            
          
            <remark>
             <p>
              Multiplicative notation can be used when working with any arbitary group, while additive notation should be used only when working with a group whose binary operation is commutative.
             </p>
            </remark>

          <p>  We summarize multiplicative versus addition notation in the following table, where <m>a,b</m> are elements of a group <m>G</m>. </p>

    <convention>
          <p>
            We <em>do</em> use the notation
            <m>*</m> when using multiplicative or additive notation would lead to
            confusion. For instance, if we want to define an operation on
            <m>\Q^*</m> that assigns to pair <m>(a,b)</m> the quantity <m>ab/2</m>, it would
            be unwise to use multiplicative or additive notation for this
            operation since we already have conventional meanings of <m>ab</m> and
            <m>a+b</m>. Similarly, we would not denote the identity element of
            <m>\Q^*</m> under this operation by <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>, since the identity
            element in this group is the rational number <m>2</m>, and writing <m>0=2</m>
            or <m>1=2</m> would look weird.
          </p>
      
</convention>
<p>Finally:</p>
<convention>
     
          <p>
            If there is a default notation for a particular
            operation (say, <m>\circ</m> for composition of functions) or identity
            element (say, <m>I_n</m> in <m>GL(n,\R)</m>) we usually use that notation
            instead.

    <title>Some group properties</title>
    <p>
      While we don't need to worry about <q>order</q> when multiplying a group element <m>a</m> by itself, we <em>do</em> need to worry about it in general.
    </p>

    <warning>
      <p>
        Group operations need <em>not</em> be commutative!
      </p>
    </warning>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A group <m>\langle G, \cdot\,\rangle</m> is said to be <term>abelian</term> if <m>ab=ba</m> for all <m>a,b\in
          G</m>. Otherwise, <m>G</m> is <term>nonabelian</term>. (The word <q>abelian</q> derives from the surname of
          mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <remark>
      <p>
        If we know that a binary operation <m>\cdot</m>
        on a set <m>G</m> is commutative, then in checking to see if axioms
        <m>\G_2</m> and <m>\G_3</m> hold we need only verify that there exists
        <m>e\in G</m> such that <m>ae=a</m> (we don't need to check that
        <m>ea=a</m>) for all <m>a\in G</m> and that for each <m>a\in G</m> there
        exists <m>b\in G</m> such that <m>ab=e</m> (we don't need to check that
        <m>ba=e</m>).
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is not known to be abelian, we
        must be careful when multiplying elements of <m>G</m> by one
        another: multiplying on the left is, in general, not the same
        as multiplying on the right!
      </p>
    </remark>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>G</m> is a group, then the cardinality <m>|G|</m> of <m>G</m> is
          called the <term>order of <m>G</m></term>. If <m>|G|</m> is finite, then <m>G</m> is
          said to be a <term>finite group</term>; otherwise, it's an <term>infinite group</term>.

          Of the groups we've discussed, which are abelian? Which are infinite/finite?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      We have already seen that identity elements of groups are unique,
      and that each element <m>a</m> of a group <m>G</m> has a unique inverse
      <m>a^{-1}\in G</m>. Here are some other basic properties of groups.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="cancel">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\Gdot</m> is a group, then <em><em>left and right cancellation laws</em></em> hold in <m>G</m>. That is, if <m>a,b,c\in G</m>, then
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a,b,c\in G</m> and assume that <m>ab=ac</m>. Multiplying
        both equation sides on the left by <m>a^{-1}</m>, we obtain

        This proves that the left cancellation law holds. A similar proof shows that the right cancellation law holds.

  <theorem xml:id="divalg"><title>Division Algorithm</title>
<statement><p>

Let <m>n\in \Z^+</m> and let <m>a</m> be any
    integer. Then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>, with <m>0\leq
    r \lt n</m>, such that <m>a=qn+r</m>.</p>




    <p>(This is actually a special case
    of a more general theorem, which states that given any integers <m>n</m>
    and <m>a</m>, there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>, with <m>0\leq
    r\lt |n|</m>, such that <m>a=qn+r</m>.)</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

  <p>
    It follows that for each positive integer <m>n</m> and integer <m>a</m>,
    there exists a unique element <m>R_n(a)</m> (the <m>r</m> in the above
    theorem) of the set <m>\{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1\}</m> such that <m>a</m> is
    congruent to <m>R_n(a)</m> modulo <m>n</m>. For example, <m>R_3(4)=1</m>, <m>R_3(0)=0</m>,

    The set <m>\{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1\}</m> of remainders when dividing by <m>n</m> is so important we give it a

<statement>
  <p>
    We define <m>\Z_n</m> to be the set <m>\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}</m>.
  </p>
</statement>

  </definition>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Note that by our definition of <m>\Z_n</m>, the
      integer <m>n</m> itself is <em>not</em> in <m>\Z_n</m>!
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    We are now ready to consider our next type of group.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <notation><usage>\Z_n</usage><description>the cyclic group of order <m>n</m></description></notation>
        For each <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, <m>\langle \Z_n,+_n\rangle</m> is a group, called the <em>cyclic group of order <m>n</m></em> (we will see later why we use the word <q>cyclic</q> here).
        This group is abelian and of order <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We first check that <m>\langle\Z_n,+_n\rangle</m> is a binary structure. Note
        that by the definition of <m>+_n</m>, <m>a+_nb \in \Z_n</m> for each
        <m>a,b\in \Z</m>. Thus, <m>a+_nb \in \Z_n</m> for each <m>a,b\in \Z_n</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We next check that <m>\Z_n</m> under <m>+_n</m> satisfies the three group
        axioms. Note that since addition is commutative on <m>\Z</m>,
        <me>a+_n b =R_n(a+b)=R_n(b+a)=b+_n a</me>
        for all <m>a,b\in \Z_n</m>. Again, a
        simpler way of stating this is that commutativity of <m>+_n</m> on
        <m>\Z_n</m> is inherited from the commutativity of addition on <m>\Z</m>.
        One nice result of this is that since <m>+_n</m> is commutative on
        <m>\Z_n</m>, we have less to check when verifying group axioms
        <m>\G_2</m> and <m>\G_3</m>.</p>


            <p>
              Now, let <m>a,b,c\in \Z_n</m>.  We want to show that
              <m>(a+_n b)+_n c = a +_n(b+_n c)</m>. Now,
              <md>
                <mrow>(a+_n b)+_n c\amp =R_n(a+b)+_n c</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv_n R_n(a+b)+c\</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv_n (a+b)+c\</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv_n a+(b+c)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv_n a+R_n(b+c)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \equiv_n a+_n (b+_n c).</mrow>
              </md>
              So <m>(a+_n b)+_n c</m> and <m>a+_n (b+_n c)</m> are congruent mod <m>n</m>.  Since
              both of these values are in <m>\{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}</m>, this implies that
              they are equal, as desired.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, clearly, <m>0\in \Z_n</m> acts as an identity element
              under <m>+_n</m>, since
              <me> 0+_n a =R_n(0+a)=R_n(a)</me>
              for each
              <m>a\in \Z_n</m>.
            </p>
          <p>Finally, let <m>a\in \Z_n</m>.  If <m>a=0</m>, then clearly <m>a</m> has
              inverse <m>0\in \Z_n</m> since <m>0+_n 0 = 0</m>. If <m>a\neq 0</m>, then
              the element <m>n-a\in \Z_n</m> is an inverse for <m>a</m> since
              <me>a+_n(n-a)=R_n(a+(n-a))=R_n(n)=0.</me>
            </p>

      <p>
        Since <m>+_n</m> is commutative on <m>\Z_n</m>, <m>\Z_n</m> is an abelian group under <m>+_n</m>. </p>
<p>
Finally, we already know that <m>|\Z_n|=|\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}|=n</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

  </example>

  <remark>
    <p>
      In practice, we often omit the
      subscript <m>n</m> and just write <m>+</m> when discussing addition
      modulo <m>n</m> on <m>\Z_n</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <warning>
    <p>
      Do not confuse <m>n\Z</m> and <m>\Z_n</m>! They are very different as sets and as groups.
    </p>
  </warning>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In the group <m>\langle \Z_8,+\rangle</m> (where, as indicated by our above remark, <m>+</m> means addition modulo <m>8</m>), we have, for instance, <m>3+7=2</m> and <m>7+7=6</m>.
        The numbers 2 and 6 are each other's inverse, and <m>7^{-1}=1</m>. The number <m>0</m> has inverse <m>0</m> (it can't be <m>8</m>, since <m>8\not\in \Z_8</m>!).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>n\in \Z^+</m>, we define <term>multiplication modulo <m>n</m></term>, denoted <m>\cdot_n</m>, on <m>\Z_n</m> by <m>a\cdot_n b = R_n(ab)</m>, the remainder when <m>ab</m> is divided by <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      <m>\Z_n</m> is never a group under <m>\cdot_n</m> (do you see why?).
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    But we can consider the following

  <definition>
  <notation><usage>\Z_n^{\times}</usage><description><m>\{a\in \Z_n\,:\,\gcd(a,n)=1\}</m></description></notation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>n\in \Z^+</m>,
        we define <m>\Z_n^{\times}</m> to be the set <me>\{a\in \Z_n\,:\,\gcd(a,n)=1\}</me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
      
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>\langle \Z_n^{\times},\,\cdot_n\, \rangle</m> is a group under multiplication. We omit the proof.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    We end this section by considering a few more examples.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="funcrr">
    <statement>
      <p>
  <notation><usage>F</usage><description>the set of all functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m></description></notation>
        Let <m>F</m> be the set of all functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>, and define <em>pointwise addition</em> <m>+</m> on <m>F</m> by
        <me>(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)</me>
        for all <m>f,g\in F</m> and <m>x\in \R</m>. We claim that <m>F</m> is a group under pointwise
        addition. (For variety, in this proof we don't explicitly refer
        to <m>\G_1</m><ndash /><m>\G_3</m>, though we certainly do verify they hold.)</p>
</statement>

<proof>
       <p>  If <m>f,g\in F</m> then clearly <m>f+g</m> is also a function
        from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>, so <m>\langle F,+\rangle</m> is a binary structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, let <m>f,g,h\in F</m>. Then for all <m>x\in \R</m>,
        <md>
          <mrow>((f+g)+h)(x)\amp =(f+g)(x)+h(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =((f(x)+g(x))+h(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =f(x)+(g(x)+h(x))\amp \amp \text{ (since addition is associative on
          \(\R\)) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =f(x)+(g+h)(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =(f+(g+h))(x)\amp \amp .</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note
        that the key fact used in this argument is that <m>f(x)</m>, <m>g(x)</m> and
        <m>h(x)</m> all lie in <m>\R</m>, and addition is associative on <m>\R</m>.
        When you get used to such arguments, it is sufficient to say that
        associativity of <m>+</m> on <m>F</m> is <em>inherited</em> from the
        associativity of addition on <m>\R</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, let <m>z:\R\to\R</m> be the function <m>z(x)=0</m> for all <m>x</m>. Then for all <m>f\in F</m> and <m>x\in \R</m>,
     <md>
          <mrow>(f+z)(x)\amp =f(x)+z(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =f(x)+0\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =f(x)\amp \amp </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =0+f(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =z(x)+f(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = (z+f)(x).</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        So <m>z</m> is an identity element of <m>\langle F,+\rangle</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, let <m>f\in F</m>, and define <m>g\in F</m> by <m>g(x)=-f(x)</m> for all <m>x\in \R</m>. It is easy then to see that <m>g</m> is an inverse for <m>f</m> in <m>F</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, <m>F</m> is a group under pointwise addition. Note that it is uncountably infinite and abelian.
