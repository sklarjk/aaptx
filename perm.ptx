  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have already been introduced to two important classes of
      nonabelian groups: namely, the matrix groups <m>GL(n,\R)</m> and
      <m>SL(n,\R)</m> for <m>n\geq 2</m>. We now consider a more general class of
      (mostly) nonabelian groups: permutation groups.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>permutation</term> on a set <m>A</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m>
        to <m>A</m>. We say a permutation <m>\sigma</m> on <m>A</m> <term>fixes</term> <m>a\in
        A</m> if <m>\sigma(a)=a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example xml:id="stperm">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be the set <m>A=\{\Delta, \star, 4\}</m>. Then the functions <m>\sigma : A\to A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \sigma(\Delta)=\star,
          \sigma(\star)=\Delta,  \text{and }  \sigma(4)=4;
        </me>
        and <m>\tau : A\to A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \tau(\Delta)=4, 
          \tau(\star)=\Delta,  \text{and }  \tau(4)=\star
        </me>
        are
        both permutations on <m>A</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Composition of permutations on a set <m>A</m> is often called
        <term>permutation multiplication</term>, and if <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m>
        are permutations on a set <m>A</m>, we usually omit the composition
        symbol and write <m>\sigma \circ \tau</m> simply as <m>\sigma \tau</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <warning>
    <p>
      For us, if <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are permutations on a set <m>A</m>, then applying <m>\sigma \tau</m> to <m>A</m> means first applying <m>\tau</m> and <em>then</em> applying <m>\sigma</m>. This is due to the conventional right-to-left reading of function compositions.
    </p>
  </warning>

  <p>
    That is, if <m>a\in A</m>, by <m>\sigma \tau(a)</m> we mean <m>\sigma(\tau(a))</m>. (Some other books/mathematicians do not use this convention, and read permutation multiplication from left-to-right.
    Make sure to always know what convention your particular author or colleague is using!)
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>\sigma</m>, and <m>\tau</m> be as in <xref ref="stperm">Example</xref>.
        Then <m>\sigma \tau</m> is the function from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \sigma \tau(\Delta)=4,  \sigma \tau(\star)=\star,  \text{and }  \sigma \tau(4)=\Delta,
        </me>
        while <m>\tau \sigma</m> is
        the function from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> defined by
        <me>
          \tau \sigma (\Delta)=\Delta,  \tau \sigma (\star)=4,  \text{and }  \tau \sigma(4)=\star

  <theorem xml:id="sym">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a set <m>A</m>:
        <ol>
          <li>            <p>
              <m>S_A</m> is a group under permutation multiplication.

          <li>            <p>
              If <m>A</m> has finite cardinality <m>n</m>, then <m>|S_A|=n!</m> (if <m>|A|=\infty</m> then <m>|S_A|</m> is also <m>\infty</m>).

          <li>            <p>
              <m>S_A</m> is abelian if <m>|A|=1</m> or <m>2</m>, and nonabelian otherwise.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
   <p>
<ol><li><p>
      Let <m>\sigma, \tau \in S_A</m>. Since a composition of
      bijections is a bijection (see <xref ref="compbij">Theorem</xref>), <m>\sigma
      \tau</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m>, hence is in <m>S_A</m>. So
      <m>\langle S_A,\circ\rangle</m> is a binary structure</p> <p>Next, function composition is always associative.</p><p> The identity function <m>1_A : A\to A</m> defined by
            <me>
              1_A(a)=a \text{ for all \(a\in A\)}
            </me>
            clearly acts as an
            identity element in <m>S_A</m>. Henceforth, we will denote <m>1_A</m>
            by <m>e</m>.
          </p>
        <p>
            Finally, let <m>\sigma \in S_A</m>.  Since <m>\sigma</m> is a
            bijection, <m>\sigma</m> has an inverse function <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>
            that is also a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> (<xref ref="invbij">Theorem</xref>). Since <m>\sigma^{-1}\in S_A</m> with <m>\sigma
            \sigma^{-1}= \sigma^{-1} \sigma=1_A</m>, every element of
            <m>S_A</m> has an inverse element in <m>S_A</m>.
          </p>
    <p>
      So <m>S_A</m> is a group.
    </p></li>
<li>
  <p>
    Clearly <m>|S_A|=\infty</m> when <m>|A|=\infty</m>, and a straightforward
    combinatorial argument yields that when <m>|A|=n \in \Z^+</m>, we have
    <m>|S_A|=n!</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if <m>|A|=1</m> or <m>2</m>, then <m>|S_A|=1!=1</m> or
    <m>|S_A|=2!=2</m> so <m>S_A</m> must be abelian (as it's a group of order 1 or
    2). On the other hand, suppose <m>|A|>2</m>. Then <m>A</m> contains at least
    three distinct elements, say <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>. Let <m>\sigma</m> be the
    permutation of <m>A</m> swapping <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and fixing every other
    element of <m>A</m>, and let <m>\tau</m> be the permutation of <m>A</m> swapping
    <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> and fixing every other element of <m>A</m>. Then <m>\sigma
    \tau(x)=y</m> while <m>\tau \sigma(x)=z</m>, so <m>\sigma \tau \neq \tau
    \sigma</m>, and hence <m>S_A</m> is nonabelian.</p></li></ol></p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
    We will in the future use language provided by the following
    definition:
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A group is said to be a <term>permutation group</term> if it is
        a subgroup of <m>S_A</m> for some set <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Notice
      that if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, then <m>|A|=|B|</m> if and only if
      <m>S_A\simeq S_B</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    Thus, for any set <m>B</m> with <m>|B|=n \in \Z^+</m>, we have <m>S_B\simeq
    S_A</m>, where <m>A=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m>. Since we are concerned in this
    course primarily with group structures which are invariant under
    isomorphism, we may focus now on groups of permutations on the set
    <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m> (<m>n\in \Z^+</m>).</p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        When <m>A=\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m> (<m>n\in \Z^+</m>), we call <m>S_A</m>
        the <term>symmetric group on <m>n</m> letters</term> and denote it by
        <m>S_n</m>.
      </p>
      
<p>    (We can, in fact,  define <m>S_0</m>, the set of all permutations on the empty set. One can show, using the fact that a function is a relation on a Cartesian product of sets, that <m>S_0</m> is the trivial group. However, this will not be relevant in this text.)</p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark>
    <p>
      Throughout this course, if we are discussing a
      group <m>S_n</m>, you should assume <m>n\in \Z^+</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    It is important for us to be able to easily describe specific elements of <m>S_n</m>. It would be cumbersome to describe, for instance, an element of <m>S_3</m> by saying it swaps <m>1</m> and <m>2</m> and fixes <m>3</m>; imagine how much more cumbersome it could be to describe an element of, say, <m>S_{100}</m>! One can somewhat concisely describe a permutation <m>\sigma</m> of <m>S_n</m> by listing out the elements <m>1,2,\ldots,n</m> and writing the element <m>\sigma(i)</m> below each <m>i</m> for <m>i=1,2,\ldots, n</m>.
    For instance, if <m>\sigma</m> sends <m>1</m> to <m>2</m>, we'd write the number <m>2</m> below the number <m>1</m>. The convention is to enclose these two rows of numbers in a single set of parentheses, as in the following example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="nocommute">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We can denote the element <m>\sigma</m> of <m>S_3</m> that swaps <m>1</m> and <m>2</m> and fixes <m>3</m> by
        <me>
          \sigma = \begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 2\amp 1\amp 3
          \end{pmatrix},
        </me>
        and the element <m>\tau</m> of <m>S_3</m> that sends <m>1</m> to <m>3</m>, <m>2</m> to <m>1</m>, and <m>3</m> to <m>2</m> by
        <me>
          \tau =\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 3\amp 1\amp 2
          \end{pmatrix}.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Then
        <me>
          \sigma\tau = \begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 3\amp 2\amp 1
          \end{pmatrix}</me> and
        
<me>          \tau\sigma = \begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\amp 3\\ 1\amp 3\amp 2
          \end{pmatrix}.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    But even this notation is unnecessarily cumbersome. Instead, we
    use <em>cycle notation</em>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A permutation <m>\sigma</m> in <m>S_n</m> is called a <term><m>k</m>-cycle</term> or a <term>cycle of length <m>k</m></term> (or, less
        specifically, a <term>cycle</term>) if there exist distinct elements <m>a_1,
        a_2,\ldots, a_k</m> in <m>\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> such that

      <ul>
      <li><p>
        <m>\sigma(a_i)=a_{i+1}</m> for each <m>i=1,2,\ldots, k-1</m>;</p></li>
<li><p><m>\sigma(a_k)=a_1</m>;</p></li>
       <li><p><m>\sigma(x)=x</m> for every other element of <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>.</p></li>
        </ul>
</p>
      <p>
        We use the <term>cycle notation</term> <m>\sigma = (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_k)</m> to describe such a cycle. A <m>2</m>-cycle is often called a <term>transposition</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example xml:id="tr">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The permutation <m>\tau</m> in <m>S_3</m> that sends <m>1</m> to <m>3</m>, <m>2</m> to <m>1</m>, and <m>3</m> to <m>2</m> is a cycle. It can be denoted by <m>\tau =(132)</m>.
        Similarly, the cycle <m>\rho</m> in <m>S_3</m> swapping <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> can be denoted by <m>\rho=(13)</m>. On the other hand, the permutation in <m>S_4</m> that swaps <m>1</m> with <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> with <m>4</m> is
        <em>not</em> a cycle.

      Given a <m>k</m>-cycle <m>\sigma=(a_1 a_2\cdots a_k)</m>, there are <m>k</m> different expressions for <m>\sigma</m>. Indeed, we have

    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    However, by convention, we usually <q>start</q> a cycle <m>\sigma</m>
    with the smallest of the numbers that <m>\sigma</m> doesn't fix: e.g.,
    we'd write <m>\sigma=(213)</m> as <m>(132)</m>.

        Two cycles <m>\sigma=(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_k)</m> and <m>\tau=(b_1

      Note that if cycles <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are disjoint, then <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> commute; that is, <m>\sigma \tau=\tau \sigma</m>.

  <warning>

      If cycles <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are <em>not</em> disjoint then they may not commute. For instance, see <xref ref="nocommute">Example</xref>, where <m>\sigma\tau \neq \tau \sigma</m>.

  <p>
    Note that any permutation of <m>S_n</m> is a product of disjoint cycles (where by <q>product</q> we mean the permutation resulting from permutation multiplication).
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Writing a permutation in <term>(disjoint)

  <remark>
    <p>
      Note that if <m>\sigma</m> in <m>S_n</m> is
      written in cycle notation and the number <m>a\in \{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>
      appears nowhere in <m>\sigma</m>'s representation, this means that
      <m>\sigma</m> fixes <m>a</m>. The only permutation that we cannot really write

        is the product of disjoint cycles
        <m>(132)</m> and <m>(46)</m>, so in cycle notation we have

      <p>
        While it is true that we also have <m>\sigma=(13)(23)(46)</m>, this is not a disjoint cycle representation of <m>\sigma</m> since both <m>(13)</m> and <m>(23)</m> <q>move</q> the element <m>3</m>.

        Any <m>k</m>-cycle has order <m>k</m> in <m>S_n</m>. More generally, if permutation <m>\sigma</m> can be written in disjoint cycle notation as <m>\sigma=\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_m</m>, then

    <p>
      Permutation <m>\sigma</m> must be in <em>disjoint</em> cycle notation for the above formula to hold. For instance, let <m>\sigma=(12)(23)</m> in <m>S_3</m>. The transpositions <m>(12)</m> and <m>(23)</m> both have order <m>2</m>, but <m>o(\sigma)\neq \lcm(2,2)=2</m>. Rather, <m>o(\sigma)=3</m>, since in disjoint cycle notation <m>\sigma</m> can be written as <m>\sigma=(123)</m>. You must write a permutation using disjoint cycle notation before attempting to use this method to compute its order!

  <p>
    One might wonder how <q>common</q> permutation groups are in math. They
    are, it turns out, ubiquitous in abstract algebra: in fact, <em>every group</em> can be thought of as a group of permutations! We will
    prove this, but we first need the following lemma. (We will not use
    the maps <m>\rho_a</m> or <m>c_a</m>, defined below, in our theorem, but
    define them here for potential future use.)
  </p>

  <lemma xml:id="cay_lem">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>a\in G</m>. Then the
        following functions are permutations on <m>G</m>, and hence are elements
        of <m>S_G</m>:


        <ul>
          <li>
            
            <p>
              <m>\lambda_a\,:\,G\to G</m> defined by <m>\lambda_a(x)=ax</m>;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>        
            <p>
              <m>\rho_a\,:\,G\to G</m> defined by <m>\rho_a(x)=xa</m>;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
      
            <p>
              <m>c_a\,:\,G\to G</m> defined by <m>c_a(x)=axa^{-1}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
      To show that <m>\lambda_a</m> is a bijection, first assume <m>x_1,x_2 \in G</m> with
      <m>\lambda_a(x_1)=\lambda_a(x_2)</m>. Then <m>ax_1=ax_2</m>; so, by left
      cancellation, <m>x_1=x_2</m>. Thus, <m>\lambda_a</m> is one-to-one. Further,
      each <m>y\in G</m> equals <m>\lambda_a(a^{-1}y)</m> for <m>a^{-1}y\in G</m>, so
      <m>\lambda_a</m> is onto. Thus, <m>\lambda_a</m> is a bijection from <m>G</m> to
      <m>G</m>: that is, it's a permutation on <m>G</m>. The proofs that <m>\rho_a</m> and
      <m>c_a</m> are bijections are similar.

We say that <m>\lambda_a</m>, <m>\rho_a</m>, and <m>c_a</m>
    perform on <m>G</m>, respectively, <term>left multiplication by <m>a</m></term>, <term>right multiplication by <m>a</m></term>, and <term>conjugation by <m>a</m></term>. (Note: Sometimes when people talk about conjugation by <m>a</m> they
    instead are referring to the permutation of <m>G</m> that sends each <m>x</m>
    to <m>a^{-1}xa</m>.)

</definition>

  <p>
    Now we are ready for our theorem:
  </p>

  <theorem><title>Cayley's Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
       Let <m>G</m> be a group. Then <m>G</m>
        is isomorphic to a subgroup of <m>S_G</m>. Thus, every group can be
        thought of as a group of permutations.
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
    <p>
      For each <m>a\in G</m>, let <m>\lambda_a</m> be defined, as above, by
      <m>\lambda_a(x)=ax</m> for each <m>x\in G</m>; recall that each <m>\lambda_a</m> is
      in <m>S_G</m>. Now define <m>\phi\,:\, G\to S_G</m> by <m>\phi(a)=\lambda_a</m>,
      for each <m>a\in G</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We claim that <m>\phi</m> is both a homomorphism and one-to-one. Indeed,
      let <m>a,b\in G</m>. Now, <m>\phi(a)\phi(b)</m> and <m>\phi(ab)</m> are both
      functions with domain <m>G</m>, so we need to show
      <m>(\phi(a)\phi(b))(x)=(\phi(ab))(x)</m> for each <m>x\in G</m>. Well, let
      <m>x\in G</m>. Then
      <md>
        <mrow>(\phi(a)\phi(b))(x)\amp =(\lambda_a\lambda_b)(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\lambda_a(\lambda_b(x)) \amp \amp \text{ (since the operation on \(S_G\) is
        composition) }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\lambda_a(bx)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =a(bx)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =(ab)x\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\lambda_{ab}(x)\amp \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =(\phi(ab))(x).\amp \amp</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      So <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism. Further, if <m>a, b\in G</m> with
      <m>\phi(a)=\phi(b)</m>, then <m>\lambda_a=\lambda_b</m>. In particular,
      <m>\lambda_a(e)=\lambda_b(e)</m>. But <m>\lambda_a(e)=ae=a</m> and
      <m>\lambda_b(e)=be=b</m>, so <m>a=b</m>. Thus, <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since by definition <m>\phi(G)</m> we have that <m>\phi</m> maps <m>G</m> <em>onto</em> <m>\phi(G)</m>, we conclude that <m>\phi</m> provides an isomorphism
      from <m>G</m> to the subgroup <m>\phi(G)</m> of <m>S_G</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
</theorem>
 
 <remark>

  <p>
    In general, <m>\phi(G) \neq S_G</m>, so we cannot
    conclude that <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>S_G</m> itself; rather, we may only
    conclude that it is is isomorphic to some <em>subgroup</em> of
    <m>S_G</m>.
  </p>

  </remark>

  <remark>
    <p>
      While we chose to use the maps <m>\lambda_a</m> to
      prove the above theorem, we could just as well have used the maps
      <m>\rho_a</m> or <m>c_a</m>, instead.

<section xml:id="dihedralgps">
  <title>Dihedral groups</title>
  <p>
    Dihedral groups are groups of symmetries of regular <m>n</m>-gons. We start with an example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="D3">
    <p>
      Consider a regular triangle <m>T</m>, with vertices labeled <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>3</m>. We show <m>T</m> below, also using dotted lines to indicate a vertical line of symmetry of <m>T</m> and a rotation of <m>T</m>.</p>


<sidebyside width="30%">
    <image>
    <latex-image-code>
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5, >=latex]

(0,1.732) node[above] {1} 
-- (1,0) node[right] {2}
-- (-1,0)[left] node {3}
-- cycle;

\draw[dashed] (0,1.732) -- (0,0);

\draw[->] (0,1) -- (-0.25,1);
\draw[->] (0,1) -- (0.25,1);
\draw (0.02,1.15) node [right]{$f$};

\draw [dashed,->] (1,0) to [out=210,in=-30] (-1,0);
\draw (0,-0.3) node[below] {$r$};
\end{tikzpicture}
 </latex-image-code>
  </image>
  </sidebyside>
    <p>
      Note that if we reflect <m>T</m> over the vertical dotted line (indicated in the picture by <m>f</m>), <m>T</m> maps onto itself, with <m>1</m> mapping to <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> mapping to each other. Similarly, if we rotate <m>T</m> clockwise by <m>120^{\circ}</m> (indicated in the picture by <m>r</m>), <m>T</m> again maps onto itself, this time with <m>1</m> mapping to <m>2</m>, <m>2</m> mapping to <m>3</m>, and <m>3</m> mapping to <m>1</m>. Both of these maps are called <em>symmetries</em> of <m>T</m>; <m>f</m> is a <em>reflection</em> or <em>flip</em> and <m>r</m> is a <em>rotation</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, these are not the only symmetries of <m>T</m>. If we compose
      two symmetries of <m>T</m>, we obtain a symmetry of <m>T</m>: for instance, if
      we apply the map <m>f\circ r</m> to <m>T</m> (meaning first do <m>r</m>, then do
      <m>f</m>) we obtain reflection over the line connecting <m>2</m> to the
      midpoint of line segment <m>\overline{13}</m>. Similarly, if we apply
      the map <m>f\circ (r\circ r)</m> to <m>T</m> (first do <m>r</m> twice, then do <m>f</m>)
      we obtain reflection over the line connecting <m>3</m> to the midpoint of
      line segment <m>\overline{12}</m>. In fact, every symmetry of <m>T</m> can be
      obtained by composing applications of <m>f</m> and applications of <m>r</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For convenience of notation, we omit the composition symbols, writing, for instance, <m>fr</m> for <m>f\circ r</m>, <m>r\circ r</m> as <m>r^2</m>, etc. It turns out there are exactly six symmetries of <m>T</m>, namely:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            the map <m>e</m> from <m>T</m> to <m>T</m> sending every element to itself;

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f</m> (that is, reflection over the line connecting <m>1</m> and the midpoint of <m>\overline{23}</m>);
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>r</m> (that is, clockwise rotation by <m>120^{\circ}</m>);

        <li>

        <p>
          <m>D_3</m> is a group under composition.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <proof>
      <p>
        First, as
        noted above, <m>rf=fr^2</m>. So any map of the form <m>f^ir^jf^kr^l</m>
        (<m>i,k=0,1</m>, <m>j,l=0,1,2</m>) can be written in the form <m>f^sr^t</m>
        for some <m>s,t \in \N</m>. Finally, let <m>R_2(s)</m> and <m>R_3(t)</m> be
        the remainders when you divide <m>s</m> by <m>2</m> and <m>t</m> by <m>3</m>; then
        <m>f^sr^t=f^{R_2(s)}r^{R_3(t)} \in D_3</m>. So <m>\langle D_3,\circ\rangle </m> is a binary structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, function composition is always associative, and the function <m>e</m> clearly acts as identity
              element
              in <m>D_3</m>.
         Finally, let <m>x=f^ir^j\in D_3</m>. Then <m>y=r^{3-j}f^{2-i}</m>
              is
              in <m>D_3</m> with <m>xy=yx=e</m>. So <m>D_3</m> is a group.

  <warning>
    <p>
      While <m>D_3</m> is actually isomorphic to <m>S_3</m> itself, for <m>n>3</m> we have that <m>D_n</m> is <em>not</em> isomorphic to <m>S_n</m> but is rather isomorphic to a <em>proper subgroup</em> of <m>S_n</m>. When <m>n>3</m> you can see that <m>D_n</m> cannot be isomorphic to <m>S_n</m> since <m>|D_n|=2n \lt  n! = |S_n|</m> for <m>n>3</m>.

    It is important to be able to do computations with specific elements of dihedral
    groups. We have the following theorem.

  <theorem xml:id="diords">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The following relations hold in <m>D_n</m>, for every <m>n</m>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For every <m>i</m>, <m>r^if=fr^{-i}</m> (in particular, <m>rf=fr^{-1}=fr^{n-1}</m>);
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>o(fr^i)=2</m> for every <m>i</m> (in particular, <m>f^2=e</m>);
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>o(r)=o(r^{-1})=n</m>;

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> is even, then <m>r^{n/2}</m> commutes with every element of <m>D_n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <proof>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use induction on the exponent of <m>r</m>. We already know that <m>r^1f=fr^{-1}</m>.  Now suppose <m>r^{i-1}f=fr^{-(i-1)}</m> for some <m>i\geq 2</m>.  Then
          <me>
            r^if=r(r^{i-1}f)=r(fr^{-(i-1)})=(rf)r^{-i+1}=(fr^{-1})r^{-i+1}=fr^{-i}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          For every <m>i</m>, <m>fr^i\neq e</m>, but
          <me>
            (fr^i)^2=(fr^i)(fr^i)=f(r^if)r^i=f(fr^{-i})r^i=f^2r^0=e.
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          This follows from <xref ref="invord">Theorem</xref> and the fact that <m>o(r)=n</m>.
